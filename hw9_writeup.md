I have chosen to interpret the transmission history for Alaska. 
Alaska has 29 sequences present in the phylogeny. 
One of the clades traces back to New York and contains 13 of the Alaska sequences.
Within this clade, there appears to be transmission to Michigan, Louisiana, Wisconsin, and Idaho, before transmission to Alaska within several of the subclades before showing evidence of transmission within Alaska.
However, one of the subclades originating from this New York clade does not appear to show transmission in other states/countries before transmitting to Alaska. 
This subclade shows evidence of abundant transmission within Alaska. 
This New York clade shares a common sequence ancestor with three other clades.
This ancestor appears to be in Europe. 
Two of these three clades contain only one of the Alaska sequences. 
One of these cases appears to have been transmitted from Europe (the common ancestor) to Quebec before arriving in Alaska and the other appears to have been transmitted directly from Europe to Alaska. 
The third of these three clades contains eight of the Alaska sequences. 
Of these eight sequences, two appear to be cases of transmission directly from Europe and the other six appear to have been transmitted from Europe to Utah before arriving in Alaska. 
At this point, six sequences show evidence of transmission within Alaska. 
Now, these clades already discussed share a common ancestor in Asia with the remaining Alaska sequence clade. 
This last Alaska sequence clade shows evidence of transmission within Alaska originating from transmission from Asia to Europe before arriving in Alaska. 
In summary, much of the transmission in Alaska appears to have come from out of state. 
However, there is some evidence of transmission within Alaska.
